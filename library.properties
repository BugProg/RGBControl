sentence=Control RGB LEDs with transitions and effects on Arduino boards.
paragraph=This library provides a simple interface to control RGB LEDs using PWM on Arduino-compatible boards. It supports smooth transitions (like fade), visual effects (blink, pulse, rainbow, glitch), luminosity control, and gamma correction. Designed for the Arduino Nano ESP32 but works with other boards too.
